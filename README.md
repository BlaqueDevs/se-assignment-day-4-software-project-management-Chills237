## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile follows an iterative and incremental approach, where development is broken into small, manageable cycles called sprints. In contrast, Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach, where each phase (requirements, design, development, testing, and deployment) is completed before moving to the next.
Agile Methodology
Advantages:

Faster delivery of functional components.

Easier to accommodate changing requirements.

Continuous customer feedback ensures alignment with expectations.

Encourages team collaboration and flexibility.

Disadvantages:

Requires frequent client involvement, which may not always be possible.

Harder to estimate time and budget due to evolving scope.

Less emphasis on documentation, which can lead to knowledge gaps.

Can be difficult to implement in large, regulated projects.

Waterfall Methodology
Advantages:

Clear structure with well-defined phases.

Easier cost and time estimation upfront.

Well-documented process, beneficial for future maintenance.

Works well for projects with fixed requirements (e.g., government or construction).

Disadvantages:

High risk of failure if requirements are misunderstood at the beginning.

Difficult to adapt to changes once the project has started.

Late testing phase may lead to discovering major issues too late.

Customers don’t see a working product until the end, leading to potential dissatisfaction.


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more suitable for projects that require flexibility, rapid iteration, and continuous customer feedback, these projects typically have evolving requirements, uncertain end goals, or a need for frequent updates.
Example:
Software Development Startups – A startup building a mobile app or web platform benefits from Agile because requirements may change based on user feedback.
Waterfall is ideal for projects with fixed, well-defined requirements, regulatory constraints, and minimal need for changes.
Example:
Construction & Engineering – Buildings, bridges, and roads follow a sequential process where changes in later stages can be costly and unsafe.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods of Ensuring Quality
Manual Testing – QA engineers perform exploratory testing to catch UI/UX issues and edge cases that automation may miss.

Code Reviews & Pair Programming – Developers review each other’s code to improve quality and maintain coding standards.

Test-Driven Development (TDD) – Writing tests before coding ensures that all functions meet expected behaviors.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – Involving end users to validate software functionality before final deployment.
Benefits of Maintaining High Standards
Customer Satisfaction – A well-tested product ensures a smooth user experience, reducing complaints and support issues.

Cost Efficiency – Detecting bugs early prevents costly fixes later in development or post-launch.

Brand Reputation – High-quality software builds trust and enhances the company’s credibility in the market.

Security & Compliance – Proper QA helps prevent vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches and legal issues.

Product Longevity – Well-tested applications require less maintenance and scale better over time.


## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
